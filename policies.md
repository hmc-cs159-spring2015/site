## Guiding Principles

As a class, we agreed on the following guidelines that we can use to support each other's learning:

1. DO ask (relevant) questions
2. DO let us know if we go off-topic
3. DO use examples in class
4.  DO participate evenly (in class and on group projects)
5. DO be on time
6. DON'T use laptops in class
7. DON'T bring a 5-course meal (coffee, bagel, etc. are fine, especially if that makes \# 5 easier for you!)

## Late Policy

Because we often discuss the homework assignments in class, there will
be no extensions for assignments, except in extenuating circumstances
(such as an illness). Extenuating circumstances are dealt with on a
case-by-case basis. In general, you are only excused for situations
you could not have foreseen, and only if you explain the situation at
your soonest opportunity (either directly or via someone else, such as
the Dean of Students), before the due date. If an extenuating
circumstance will affect your work on a project, you must let me know as soon as you learn about it.

Missed (P)reviews will be recorded as a zero, and are eligible to be
dropped when we calculate your final grade.

## The Honor Code
All students -- even those from other colleges -- are expected to understand and comply with
[Harvey Mudd College’s Honor Code](https://www.hmc.edu/student-life/student-handbook/). If
you haven’t already done so, you must read, sign, and abide by
[the computer-science department’s interpretation of the Honor Code](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/honesty.html)
to participate in this course.

Projects for this course will be highly collaborative. If you have any
questions about how this collaboration interacts with the honor code,
please ask me. 

## Writing Center

The Writing Center provides a welcoming space for writers to get feedback on their composition projects, whether written, spoken or visual pieces. Writing Center Consultants are prepared to assist students in any discipline with any stage of the writing process, from developing an idea to polishing a final draft. Even the most accomplished writers benefit from seeking feedback at the writing center. The center is open Sunday through Thursday evenings from 7-11 and Saturday and Sunday afternoons from 3-5.  It is located in Shanahan 1470, just up the walkway from the cafe.  You may schedule an appointment through their website, or you may simply drop in during normal hours.  If you'd like an appointment outside of normal hours, you may email writing_center@hmc.edu with your request.  You will likely find your writing center visit more valuable if you go earlier than the night before your final draft is due.

## Accommodations

If you are eligible for accommodations due to physical, learning, or psychological disabilities and you have registered with the Dean of Students office, please follow the procedures described on the Disability Services webpage. If you have not registered with the Dean of Students office, you must do so in order to receive accommodations.
